## Why did I make this fork?

- The original project used unescessary dependencies.
- The original project was missing the ability to exclude servers from being left.
- The original project wouldn't work very reliably due to Discord's API ratelimit. 


## Known issues

- You may need to run the script a few times (with a few minutes apart) if you are in many servers. 
- Some messages are inaccurate.

## Will I fix the remaining issues with this project?

- Maybe. I'm busy and have other priorities to be working on, I am aware this fork could be better implemented, however whether or not I get the chance to fix things up a bit more isn't something I can guarantee. I will do my best to handle any issues or PRs submitted.
