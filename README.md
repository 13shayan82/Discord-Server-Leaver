## How To Install :gear:

- Insert your account token(s) into the tokens.txt file. (one token per line)

- Insert any server IDs that you do not wish to leave into the exceptions.txt file. (one server ID per line)

  

## Running :zap:

- Ensure you have Python and the requests module installed. (requests should be installed by default)
- Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded/cloned the repo (if you're feeling like being extra safe, download the repo from https://github.com/13shayan82/Discord-Server-Leaver/releases/tag/stable)
- Run main.py



## Known issues üõ†Ô∏è

- You may need to run the script a few times (with a few minutes apart) if you are in many servers. The Discord API seems a bit fussy about leaving lots of servers together,even with some ratelimit circumvention. 
- This script cannot remove you from servers you own, but will report a success.
